# 🔥 Inferno

**Chaos Engineering Toolkit for Spring Boot**

> Inject faults into your application with zero setup. Test how your system handles latency, exceptions, memory pressure, timeouts, and more — right from your controller, service, or repository methods.

## 🚀 What is Inferno?

Inferno is a developer-first chaos injection library designed for Spring Boot apps.  
Inspired by Chaos Monkey and Simian Army, it allows you to simulate failures using just an annotation.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Add chaos with a single `@InjectInferno` annotation
- ⏱️ Simulate latency, timeouts, exceptions, CPU spikes, and OOM
- 🎯 Inject faults at **method level** — no global config needed
- 🔀 `AUTO` mode for random failures
- ⚙️ Works with Spring Boot Controllers, Services, and Repositories

## 💻 Demo Project

A demo Spring Boot app is available under [`inferno-simulation`](https://github.com/k99sharma/inferno/tree/main/inferno-simulation).
